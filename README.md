## Vehicle counter system


## Start infrastructure 
In order to run the application correctly we need to have mongo database running. To achieve this goal we are using docker
compose configuration.
To start the infrastructure run the following command:

* Step 1: give script file execution permissions
```sh 
chmod +x run.sh
```

* Step 2: Run scrip
```sh 
./run.sh
```
